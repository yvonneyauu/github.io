I received my PhD certificate. 

A PhD, or Doctor of Philosophy, is more than just the accumulation of knowledge in a specific field. It is fundamentally about asking meaningful questions and formulating hypotheses. It teaches how to apply scientific knowledge and logical reasoning to support or challenge these hypotheses. This degree is not only about mastering the specialized knowledge that one spends years exploring; it is about cultivating a way of thinkingâ€”developing critical thinking skills, reasoning systematically, and approaching problems with logic and rigor. In essence, a PhD shapes not just what you know, but how you think.
